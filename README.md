## bash-profile
___

Recently I have become interested in customizing my bash profile. Before I used [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh). Which is a great option, I decided the upside in having complete control over my profile is better for me.

So this repo will before scripts and prompts I like to use in my local shell.
